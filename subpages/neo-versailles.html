            <h3>Painted World: Neo-Versailles</h3>
            <i>Painted World: Neo-Versailles</i> was a collaboration between the ArtCenter College of Art and Design in 
            California and Rochester Institute of Technology. As an RIT student on the project, my main focus
            was the technical needs of the project as a programmer. The project spanned the entire academic 2022 - 2023
            year, starting for RIT in August and ending in May.
            <br><br>
            <i>Neo-Versailles</i> was on display at two different RIT events: the Student Games Showcase and Imagine RIT.

            An updated version of the inventory scripts for this project is being used by the two 2023-2024 ArtCenter collaborations.

            <h4>Lighting</h4>
            During the second semester of the development of <i>Painted World: Neo-Versailles</i>,
            I spent most of my time working on performance improvements for the game. We were running
            into issues where the frame rate would vary greatly between scenes, or the frames would be 
            so low it looked like everything was smearing across the screen. As the visual development of
            the game was the main focus of the spring, the game was slowly becoming unplayable.
            <br><br>
            Some of our major issues were a lack of culling in scenes, and given the size of these scenes and
            the polycount of our assets, it was straining most computers to run. This was fairly simple to solve
            as Unity has tools to create culling volumes. These only required a little fixing when it came to doorways
            as the player would only see a blank space after the door opened.
            <br><br>
            Our biggest problem was lighting. A large part of the visuals created for <i>Neo-Versailles</i> relied
            heavily upon the lighting used in-engine to produce the required emotion for players. Many of the team 
            had never worked in Unity before, or were inexperienced with common techniques needed to optimize larger 
            games.We What this meant on the technical end was that there were a large number of real-time lights 
            created initially within the game.
            <br><br>

            <br><br>
            The above example was our canery in the coal mine, so to speak. As the game progressed we started to see lights flickering 
            in-engine while the game was running. After investigating the problem, I found that there was an extreme number of real-time
            lights being used in that particular scene, totalling to 231 in the final lit version. 
            <br><br>
            Many of these lights were no longer providing any visuals but were still present and functioning during gameplay. 
            As you can imagine, this scene ran incredibly slow, particularly given that it was the largest scene created for the game with 
            very few large objects blocking the player's view. We <i>needed</i> this level in particular to have a high enough frame rate 
            to be effective, given it was a chase scene with the player running away from the ever-persuing demon.

            <br><br>
            Another lighting issue we ran into was overlapping UVs. These overlaps causes parts of the map to be lit incorrectly, often to an
            eye-watering degree as seen above.
