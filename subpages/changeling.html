            <h3>Changeling</h3>
            The <i>Changeling</i> VR Project started in 2020 and every semester has rotated to a different cohort of developers as an entrepreneurial co-op 
            at RIT. I joined the project for Summer 2023, about three years after development on the project. I was brought on as the lead of the new Technical 
            Art team, as there hadn't been enough technical artists prior to the group to warrant a separate group. The task we were told was our top priority on 
            the project was to go through and polish the visuals for an approaching Early Access release, which has since been delayed.
            <br><br>
            That polishing didn't really happen. Instead, the team noticed that while there were levels, VFX, animations, and post-processes present in the project, 
            the game ran so slow that it was impossible to actually enjoy the experience at all. The game sideloads into a number of VR headsets, so the technical specs 
            for each needed to be checked, although we only had a few available to us for testing. The initial fps values we found are in the table below:
            <br><br>
            <table>
                <tr>
                  <th>Level</th>
                  <th>Average</th>
                  <th>Quest 2<br>i7-11700k</th>
                  <th>Rift S<br>Ryzen 2700x</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td>Onboarding</td>
                  <td>35 fps</td>
                  <td>36 fps</td>
                  <td>30-40 fps</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Intro Noir</td>
                    <td>38 fps</td>
                    <td>36 fps</td>
                    <td>40 fps</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Mind Palace</td>
                    <td>76 fps</td>
                    <td>72 fps</td>
                    <td>80 fps</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Mother's Level</td>
                    <td>14 fps</td>
                    <td>20 fps (lowest 9)</td>
                    <td>10-20 fps</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Father's Level</td>
                    <td>9 fps</td>
                    <td>15 fps (lowest 6.8)</td>
                    <td>2.5-10 fps</td>
                </tr>
              </table> 
              <br>
              Seeing these issues, the team agreed we had one major goal for our time on the project: get each level to run at about 72-80 frames per second 
              consistently. The lowest frame rate we were comfortable allowing to pass was a consistent 60 fps, but our stretch goal was to run the game at 
              the maximum fps most VR headsets can handle at 120.
              <br><br>
              The first tasks divided amongst the team were to check for common pain points in student-made projects that could be affecting the frame rate - 
              real-time lighting, high poly models, and expensive materials and post-processes. The team found all of these.
              <br><br>
              A signficant amount of <i>Changeling's</i> assets are from asset stores and online packs made available by other developers. This came with the 
              issue that many of those assets weren't optimized for VR. We'd spend most of the rest of the summer just fixing these problems.
              <br><br>
              By the end of our first month on the project, our frames looked more like this:
