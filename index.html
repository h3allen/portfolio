            Hi! I'm a fourth year Game Design and Development student at Rochester Institute of Technology and I specialize in programming and technical art.
            <br>
            Outside of classes, I participate in game jams and group projects. I've founded and hold an eboard position on the student organization Queer in STEM (QSTEM), which was founded to help foster a welcoming community for the queer students in STEM on campus.

                    Neo-Versailles was designed by capstone students at the ArtCenter of California. As an RIT student, I was part of a team brought on to assist with the programming for the project.
                    <br><br>
                    Neo-Versailles is a First-Person Puzzle RPG Horror where the player explores a destroyed palace of Versailles through corrupted paintings. The player utilizes paint to explore the world and defend themself from the Demon of Despair.
                    <br><br>
                    As a team, we utilized SCRUM methodologies, Confluence, Jira, Perforce, and GitHub as well as Unity Engine. The team collaborated asynchronously and across time zones, so coordination was essential in keeping a constant flow of progress.
                    <br><br>
                    During the fall semester, the programming team focused on getting the base systems into the game. Personally, I worked on environmental scripting needed for levels, the backend of our inventory, the player health and ammo systems, and assisted the other programmers with debugging and testing their code. 
                    <br><br>
                    During the spring semester, I polished the systems I was working on during the fall, continued to assist in debugging and version control issues, and spearheaded optimization work. The project was lacking in basic optimizations, as most of the team had never worked on a game of that scale and had never needed to focus on this aspect before.
                    <br><br>
                    The basis of the inventory code created by both myself and another RIT student, Megan Schier, is being utilized in this yearâ€™s collaboration with ArtCenter.
