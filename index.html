                    <p>
                        Neo-Versailles was designed by capstone students at the ArtCenter of California. As an RIT student, me and a group of other GDD students were brought on to assist with the programming on the project.
                        Neo-Versailles is a First Person Puzzle Horror RPG where the player explores a destroyed palace of Versailles as well as corrupted paintings. The game uses Unity Engine.
                        As a team, we utilized SCRUM methodologies, Confluence, Jira, Perforce, and Github after some problems occurred with our Perforce server.
                        <br><br>
                        During the first semester, the programming team focused on getting the base systems into the game. Personally, I worked on environmental scripting needed for levels, the backend of our inventory, the player health and ammo systems, and assisted other developers with debugging. 
                        The project has builds and code available upon request.

                    <p>
                        Fish was developed during a 6-day-long game jam using Unity Engine. The jam's theme was 'creature' and the team completed this aspect by creating a basic fishing simulator.
                        As the player relaxes and casts their line into the water, they are accompanied by a friendly monster. The creature will only move when the player can't see them and will occasionally give the player advice, a fish fact, or tell a joke.
                        We wanted to give the creature a very fatherly-feeling prescence without ever directly saying as such to our players.
                        
                        <br><br>Personally, I worked on the dialogue system as well as the menus and UI. The concept design for the creature was collaborative across all 4 team members as well as the lines of dialogue from the creature itself.
                        I also polished up some of the code for the mechanics when the deadline approached as our gameplay programmer had to work during the jam.

                        Hatbird was created during RIT Game Dev Club's Halloween game jam in Unity. The jam lasted 44 total hours and the jam theme was sacrifice. 
                        In a team of 3, each member of the group contributed to the overall game elements and design of the game. 
                        The majority of my contributions were towards visual design elements in the game.

                        This project for RIT's Interactive Media Development [IGME 202] class utilizes steering behaviors to move the green cubes. 
                        The green cubes, zombies, are randomly placed on the field. All objects in the scene are contained on the field using steering forces. The user can control the yellow cube and needs to avoid the green cubes on the screen. 
                        The zombie cubes seek out the player and avoid one another and any white columns on screen. 
                        After catching the player, all zombies will wander around the scene. 
                        The game times how long the player can avoid the zombies for. Collisions are tracked using sphere collisions.

                        This was a part of a larger game project for RIT's Game Design and Development 2 [IGME 320] class. It served as the player character and while time constraints did not allow the team to animate it for class, I did have time to rig the character for our animator.
                        The rig uses both inverse and forward kinematics. The legs, tail and claws all uses inverse kinematic controllers in Autodesk Maya and the head uses forward kinematics, as it wasn't visible enough to the player to need anything more complex.

                        This project is the beginning of a long-term personal project using Autodesk Maya to 3D model a simple teaset covered in mushrooms.
                        Currently, the teapot is a smooth mesh and textured in Autodesk Maya, but in the future the entire project will be fully textured elsewhere.
                        The teapot took 4 hours to complete.

                        As a part of RIT's Data Structures and Algorithms I [IGME 209] course, we were tasked with making a dynamic linked library that took in information for a maze and utilized A* pathfinding to find the quickest route to the exit.
                        The DLL we wrote was then used in a program our professor created to compete against other classmates' code to see whose ran the fastest. I worked with two other classmates to complete the assignment and we often worked in calls or in the lab together on the assignment.

                        Treasure Trot is a simple project built for RIT's Intro to Game Web Tech course [IGME 235] final. It utilizes the PIXI.js library to run the key aspects of the game. 
                        The gameplay difficulty increases as the levels progress as more boxes spawn on screen for the player to collect in the same amount of time. 
                        I wrote all programs, developed, and created all visual assets.

                        Currently, it is running off of the most recent version of PIXI.js, which has had a large update that causes the game to not run. This will be fixed ASAP.

                        Using the API's documentation, I created a website that would allow the user to select what types of questions they wish to answer, and submit their answers to be scored.
                        The score is kept during the session and increases as the player tries more questions. Some categories are only available in the "any" option to keep the dropdown menu clean as the API has many different categories for quesstions.

                        Apocalypta was created as an academic project for Game Design and Development 1 [IGME 220]. With a team of 4 other students, I designed a game focused around exploring a dungeon.
                        Players were encouraged to take different strategies towards collecting the most treasure and making it out of the dungeon. We observed players keeping safe around the edges, players rushing the boss, and players battling it out with one another to steal treasure.
                        Most of the stages of the gameplay went towards balancing the different possible playstyles, while keeping the overall theming lighthearted and fun.
                        <br>I pitched the original concept and as a team, we tested, modified, and documented our process. I also worked on our visual design, particularly for our room cards.
