            Hi! I'm a recent graduate from the Rochester Institute of Technology's Game Design and Development major and I specialize in rendering engineering and technical art.
            <br><br>
            I participate and host game jams and during my time at RIT I founded the student organization Queer in STEM (QSTEM) alongside a close 
            friend in mechanical engineering, to help foster a welcoming community for queer STEM students on campus.

                    This project started with a team of four and a month-long timespan to create a game. The goal of the jam was to challenge ourselves to learn something new, which I took full advantage of. 
                    During the process of determining what we wanted to make and how, we  determined that we'd be using GameMaker. Prior to this jam, I'd never used GameMaker before and had no clue how it worked, 
                    so I spent a good portion of my time watching tutorials and reading documentation. 
                    <br><br>
                    My goal for the project was to create both our character and background art as well as experiment with shaders to reduce the workload I'd have to do as an artist 
                    to create the desired visual effect. 
                    <br><br>
                    My work led to me learning how shaders and post-processing function in GameMaker. GameMaker's shaders are in GLSL ES 1.0 unless changed by the developers, a language 
                    I also haven't used before. While the final effects were simple, they ended up being very useful in speeding up the art process.
                    <br><br>
                    I ended up with a shader that modifies the color of a sprite and a post-process that changes the saturation of sprites by a variable amount.

                    After taking Console Development in Fall 2023, a number of us decided to move on to a Production Studio to continue our exploration of the Sony Dev. Kits. 
                    We had experience on the PS4, but had yet to actually try anything practically on the PS5. Due to the number of students interested in the projects, we split into 
                    two design teams with one core team for the engine. This core engine team would work together until the needs of the projects differed.
                    <br><br>
                    I worked on the graphics part of the engine with another teammate, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/silas-mercer-2876b7191/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Silas Mercer</a>. I also ended up working on 
                    UI with <a href="https://megan-schier.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Megan Schier</a>, however, we didn't end up having a lot of time and the UI cannot be seen in the main project. 
                    <br><br>
                    The graphics side has lambertian lighting, texture and model loading, skyboxes, directional and point lights, transparency, and a basic particle system. At one point we had PBR but both design 
                    teams later admitted they didn't actually need it, so we scrapped it. We ended up having an issue where all text on textures displayed backwards, but unfortunately we did not have the time to fix it.

                    In Spring 2024, I continued the Game Graphics Programming sequence. The beginning of the course focused on DirectX 12 with us working within the API and going through the 
                    same process we had in GGP1. 
                    After the two projects had similar features, we moved on to the basics of ray tracing. As a class, we walked through both ray tracing as a console application and as a part of 
                    DX 12.

                    In the Spring 2023 semester, I took Chris Cascioli's Game Graphics Programming I class. The course focused on the basics on graphics engines using DirectX 11. 
                    Using Professor Cascioli's code as a base, the final DirectX project can load obj files, create directional and point lights, use multiple different types of texture maps to create materials, 
                    and has an adjustable radial blur around the camera. 
                    <br><br>
                    In Spring 2024, the end of GGP2 allowed us to choose to continue in DX 11 or DX 12. I ended up choosing to work in DX 11 as I was also working on a graphics engine for the <a href="#ps5">PS5</a> 
                    in a production studio. At the end of this course, I implemented basic particle effects and chromatic abberration.

                    My role as the lead technical artist on the project was to coordinate visual changes to the game in conjunction with the art 
                    team and to ensure that the game was ready for early access by the end of the year. That summer was the first time <i>Changeling</i> had dedicated 
                    technical artists and we increased the overall framerates from as low as 6 to as high 200 fps. The visuals had drastically 
                    different styles due to the majority of the assets being free or bought assets from various asset stores.

                    During Summer 2023 I worked on the entrepreneurial co-op project <i>Changeling</i>. <i>Changeling</i> is a VR game where the player explores mindscapes

                    for around 3 years.

                    Neo-Versailles was designed by capstone students at the ArtCenter of California. As an RIT student, I was part of a team brought on to assist with the programming for the project.
                    <br><br>
                    Neo-Versailles is a First-Person Puzzle RPG Horror where the player explores a destroyed palace of Versailles through corrupted paintings. The player utilizes paint to explore the world and defend themself from the Demon of Despair.
